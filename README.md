## Problem 1 : Class for Linked List with cycle
  - Implemented Operations
    - append(data): Add a new element at the end of the list
    - insertAtPos(data,pos): Insert a new element at any given position.
    - createcycle(data): Convert linear list to contain a cycle. Modify the next pointer of last to given key.
    - prepend(data): Add a new element at the beginning of the list.
    - find(key): Find if a given key is present. Returns the key if present else None.
    - delete(key): Delete an already existing element from the list.
    - detectCycleLen(): Find the number of nodes present in the cycle.
    - findlen(): Find the number of nodes in the list.

## Problem 2 : Face detection and Background Blur
  - HAAR cascade and Gaussian Blur was used to achieve the objective. 
  - Has the capability to detect multiple faces in an image and blur the rest. 
  - Made using opencv3 and python3.
